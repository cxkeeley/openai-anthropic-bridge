# Pre-tool-use hook that blocks destructive Bash commands.
#
# Designed for use with Claude Code's bypass-permissions mode as a safety net.
# Works in all permission modes — hooks always run regardless of permission settings.
#
# Installation: register in settings.json (project or global):
#   {
#     "hooks": {
#       "PreToolUse": [{
#         "matcher": "Bash",
#         "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/block-destructive.sh" }]
#       }]
#     }
#   }
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = allow
#   2 = block (reason sent to stderr, shown to Claude)
